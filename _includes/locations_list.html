    <h1>Travel Locations</h1>
    <ul>

        <li>
            <strong>Istanbul, Turkey</strong>: Best palaces and cultural/historical sights, up there for the best food along with Rome and Athens. Too much harassment and scammaz though.
            <br>

        </li>
    
        <li>
            <strong>Athens, Greece</strong>: Competing with Paris to lead the world in cigarettes per capita. Met a 10yo that was vaping. The Acropolis is cool though. Stayed in a crazy cheap hotel and skipped some good rope.
            <br>
            <a href="{{ "/athens/" | relative_url }}" target="_blank">Read more</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Vienna, Austria</strong>: Architecture, shopping, opera, concerts, this place is real classy. And Wiener does not mean sausage!
            <br>

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Tirana, Albania</strong>: Walked 5km along the highway to get to my hostel. The city is like if you randomly sampled cities across location and time from the last 100 years and then glued it together. Most friendly people I met. The food is good and cheap.
            <br>

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rome, Italy</strong>: Oversaturated but not without reason. This place was insane.
            <br>
            <a href="{{ "/rome/" | relative_url }}" target="_blank">Read more</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Paris, France</strong>: Don't go in the winter. The Louvre was really nice though. Couldn't afford to eat French dining so I ate a fat plate of lamb biryani once a day.
            <br>

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>: Vikings and boats and cold water. Clean and no smokers.
            <br>
            <a href="{{ "/stockholm/" | relative_url }}" target="_blank">Read more</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Reykjavik, Iceland</strong>: Get a car and drive away as fast as you can. Sorry Reykjavik, you can be the juiciest apple and some people just like oranges.
            <br>
