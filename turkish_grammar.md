# **Turkish Alphabet and Grammar**

The Turkish alphabet consists of **29 letters**, adapted from the Latin script. It was introduced in 1928 to replace the Ottoman Turkish script. The alphabet includes several unique letters and excludes the letters **Q**, **W**, and **X**. Turkish is a **phonetic language**, meaning words are pronounced as they are written.


Turkish has 7 letters that are not in the English alphabet. Here’s how to pronounce them:

| **Letter** | **Pronunciation**              | **Example**         | **Pronunciation of Example** |

| Ç          | "ch" as in **church**          | **Çay** (tea)       | **ch-eye**                 |
| Ğ          | Silent, stretches the vowel    | **Dağ** (mountain)  | **daah**                   |
| I          | "uh" like in **sofa**          | **Ilık** (warm)     | **uh-luhk**                |

### **Unique Features**
1. **Vowel Harmony**: Vowels in a word must harmonize (front/back and rounded/unrounded).
2. **Agglutinative Language**: Suffixes are added to root words, often changing their meaning or grammatical role.
3. **Distinct Letters**: Turkish includes additional letters to represent specific sounds not found in English.


## Vowels in Turkish

Turkish vowels are categorized into two groups: front vowels and back vowels. There are eight vowels in total:

- **Front Vowels**: e, i, ö, ü
- **Back Vowels**: a, ı, o, u

### Vowel Harmony

Turkish vowel harmony is a phonological process where vowels within a word harmonize to be either front or back. This affects suffixes added to words.

### Examples

- **Front Vowel Harmony**: 
    - ev (house) -> evler (houses)
    - köy (village) -> köyler (villages)

- **Back Vowel Harmony**: 
    - kapı (door) -> kapılar (doors)
    - okul (school) -> okullar (schools)

### Root Words in Turkish

A root word is the most basic form of a word, without any suffixes. In Turkish, root words can be nouns, verbs, adjectives, or other parts of speech.

#### Examples

- **Noun Roots**:
    - kitap (book)
    - masa (table)

- **Verb Roots**:
    - koş (run)
    - sev (love)

- **Adjective Roots**:
    - güzel (beautiful)
    - hızlı (fast)

### Infinitives in Turkish

In Turkish, infinitives are formed by adding the suffix **-mek** or **-mak** to the verb root. The choice between **-mek** and **-mak** depends on the vowel harmony rules.

#### Examples

- **-mek**:
    - gel (come) -> gelmek (to come)
    - gör (see) -> görmek (to see)

- **-mak**:
    - yaz (write) -> yazmak (to write)
    - al (take) -> almak (to take)

### Conjugation Rules in Turkish

Turkish verbs are conjugated by adding suffixes to the verb root. The suffixes change depending on the tense, mood, and person.

#### Present Tense

The present tense is formed by adding the suffixes **-yor** to the verb root, followed by the personal endings.

- **Examples**:
    - ben geliyorum (I am coming)
    - sen geliyorsun (you are coming)
    - o geliyor (he/she/it is coming)
    - biz geliyoruz (we are coming)
    - siz geliyorsunuz (you all are coming)
    - onlar geliyorlar (they are coming)

#### Past Tense

The past tense is formed by adding the suffix **-di** or **-dı** to the verb root, followed by the personal endings. The choice between **-di** and **-dı** depends on the vowel harmony rules.

- **Examples**:
    - ben geldim (I came)
    - sen geldin (you came)
    - o geldi (he/she/it came)
    - biz geldik (we came)
    - siz geldiniz (you all came)
    - onlar geldiler (they came)

#### Future Tense

The future tense is formed by adding the suffix **-ecek** or **-acak** to the verb root, followed by the personal endings. The choice between **-ecek** and **-acak** depends on the vowel harmony rules.

    - sen geleceksin (you will come)
    - o gelecek (he/she/it will come)
    - biz geleceğiz (we will come)
    - siz geleceksiniz (you all will come)
