<h1 id="berlin-27---1">Berlin 27 - 1</h1>
<p>Went clubbing with this Italian guy my age who works in a pizza shop in X, and his Italian friend who had roots in America.
Ate a lot of doner and spoke quite a lot of Turkish
Went to the big government dome</p>

<h1 id="bedlewo-1---7">Bedlewo 1 - 7</h1>
<p>Hung out with some cool polish grad students
Played board games with Allen
Met Paul Zinn Justin very nice guy who had a midlife crisis
Met Nora who loves to gossip
Met a Chinese girl postdoc who moved to Poland and was quite unhappy</p>

<h1 id="prague-7---9">Prague 7 - 9</h1>
<p>Unremarkable tourist trap, large groups of drunk tourists largely from western Europe and then Chinese people.
Stayed in a crazy working class hostel, my clothes reeked of heavy metal</p>

<h1 id="brno-9---10">Brno 9 - 10</h1>
<p>Went to this cool catacomb with preserved mummies of the brothers of the monastary. Their bodies were decorated according to how many years in the monastary they had served.
Quit drinking
It was nice and cute</p>

<h1 id="budapest-10---12">Budapest 10 - 12</h1>
<p>A lot of fun. 
Did a lot of running along the river which was really nice. The route always ended at this Langos shop in the subway station which was absolutely great.
Ate a lot of nice food from a local canteen.</p>

<h1 id="milanturin-12---14">Milan/Turin 12 - 14</h1>
<p>So fucking hot, I liked Turin better than Milano.
Just wandered around the city, explored a university campus.

The first night I stayed outside the city and the girl working the reception kinda fell in love with me. She added me on wechat under the guise of the hotel needing my wechat information.

<p>Got the fa earrings at the majiang museum</p>

<p>14 hour train ride to Kunming. This was absolutely insane, I had to stand for the first 5 hours, then I finally took my seat, but it was occupied by a family who insisted I trade with them, they sent me 2 cars down and I took their seat, but then a girl insisted I trade with her so she could sit with her friends.
