        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>I'm an incoming graduate student at UC Berkeley broadly interested in algebraic geometry.  </p>
        <!-- Kac-Moody groups, their flag varieties, and representation theory -->
        <!-- integrable systems, conformal field theory, and the representation theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras -->
        <!-- Geometry of Flag Varieties in Representation Theory -->
        <p>Previously I was an undergraduate at Cornell University, where I had the great fortune of working with Professor Allen Knutson and Professor Tara Holm.</p>
