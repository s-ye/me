# Brno 9 - 10
Went to this cool catacomb with preserved mummies of the brothers of the monastary. Their bodies were decorated according to how many years in the monastary they had served.
Quit drinking
It was nice and cute

# Budapest 10 - 12
A lot of fun. 
Did a lot of running along the river which was really nice. The route always ended at this Langos shop in the subway station which was absolutely great.
Ate a lot of nice food from a local canteen.

Hung out with a bunch of Italians, I think they liked how passionate about Italy I was, a la Sopranos.

# Shanghai 3 nights 21st 
Disasterous hotel situation, the room somehow leaked and my backpack was soaked with dirty water, I had to wash all of my clothes and the bag 4 times.
# Suzhou 3 nights
Very cute, the gardens were really nice, girls like to doll up and take pretty pictures.
# Nanjing 4 nights
Very hot.
Historically very rich. Went to the purple mountain.
The first night I stayed outside the city and the girl working the reception kinda fell in love with me. She added me on wechat under the guise of the hotel needing my wechat information. She told me that she had just moved to the city from dongbei and she asked me to send her a voice message wishing her good night, and I knew it had to be stopped.
Had interesting yan shui ya.


# Xian 4 nights
- Terra Cotta Warriors
- City Wall
- Datang Everbright City to the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda

Complete disaster museum wise. Probably the most toured city in China and I could not visit anything due to the way museum reservations on wechat work, it's pretty much a hit or miss and every museum miniprogram would not open for me.


# Chengdu 7 nights 6th - 13th
Very nice, did a lot of shopping at Camel and Decathlon
Saw a very nice dance drama.

# Chongqing 6 nights 13th - 19th
Crazy urban architecture, the metro station where the train passes through the building, the bridge across the Yangzte, the Crystal. It's a very beautiful city.
Hiked up the Nanshan.

Saw face changing and tea pouring performance when I visited the guild hall.

Did a lot of walking around this plaza near my hotel. Ate at nearby canting, and had some street food along this one haochijie, where many vendors discount things starting at 10pm

Got the fa earrings at the majiang museum

14 hour train ride to Kunming. This was absolutely insane, I had to stand for the first 5 hours, then I finally took my seat, but it was occupied by a family who insisted I trade with them, they sent me 2 cars down and I took their seat, but then a girl insisted I trade with her so she could sit with her friends. I bummed a cigarette off this guy

- glad I had my evisa printed out
- glad I didn't have a bus ticket booked in advance, was able to really easily able to get on the next bus but only because I spoke Chinese
