## Happenings

First day in Stockholm nothing remarkable. Incidentally caught the changing of the guard at the national palace, some pretty good fortune. They had more female guards than I have seen traditionally at other palaces in Europe, good for them.

Second day spoke with a woman from Kenya who was very sweet and offered me breakfast in the hostel common room.

Third day spoke with a man from Congo
