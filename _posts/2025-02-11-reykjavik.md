## General Remarks
Rented a car. Important to take comprehensive pictures of the rental in the parking lot before and after your reservation. Also everything is so expensive. 
Gas stations put a hold on your card for approximately 300 USD, but they do release it.
Also the speeding tickets are brutal and they have cameras near the big cities, signage is always posted approximately 1km before the camera but signage of camera need not imply camera. The locals drive like they don't believe in car accidents.
## Happenings

First three nights, I drove around the ring road along the 1 and like an idiot decided that I would sleep in the car. Finally started coughing up the money on the 4th night and later. Too lazy to write down the major attractions but just use Google Maps and search attractions, read the reviews.
