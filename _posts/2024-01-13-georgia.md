hike from Mestia to Ushguli

Tbilisi
Kutaisi
Batumi
Stepantsminda
Signagi

Georgia is pretty small so you can either rent a car or download an app and hire a driver (it's pretty cheap) who will drive you everywhere.

Bus tour of the Georgian wine country around Signagi and it was amazing and met some really cool people who I'm still Insta friends with and talk to.

Food is great and wine is cheap. I highly recommend trying to Adjaran khachapuri.
