## Happenings
I ride the train from the airport to the city center. Before I get on the train, there is a sign that says free entrance. Therefore I do not buy a ticket. I get on the train and the conductor starts checking tickets. Fuck. She gets to me and I sheepishly tell her it is my first time in the country and that the sign said free entrance. She says that I have to pay 64 Euro. I tell her I cannot pay as I am a student and I will not be able to afford my hotel. She says I have to pay or else she will call the police and they will take my passport. I call the bluff and say that I will talk to the police. I deboard the train and three police officers come rushing over. They insist I hand my passport over. I ask if they will return it and they take this as a refusal. They put their hands on me. I finally hand it over, praying that they will return it, and then they start entering in my data into their system. They ultimately return my passport and give me a ticket for 114 Euro. I got a free ride on the airport train. Absolutely insane.

I went looking for fresh pizza. It took me three tries. In Rome. The first two places I went, I got served frozen pizza and had to send it back. I was absolutely stunned.

It was beer pong night in the bar. Met a cool wasian guy named Kenji from Arizona, two Canadians from Saskatechewan, and a Frenchman. We had some drinks and then we decided to Uber to the bar. It was a very nice bar. Some Americans studying abroad from the hostel also decided pull up and we had a blast. It was my first time actually having fun at a bar, and I have tried a lot of times to do so.
