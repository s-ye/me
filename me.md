**About Me**

I was born in Shanghai and raised in Chicago. I love traveling, lifting weights, running, and riding motorcycles. I also enjoy playing poker and am currently learning both Spanish and Chinese.

Books are a big part of my life, and my favorite author is John Steinbeck.

Thanks for visiting my site!
