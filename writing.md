# Writing
- We exposit Danilov's theorem, which describes the equivariant cohomology of a smooth complete toric variety in terms of its normal fan. [Equivariant Cohomology and Moment Maps in Toric Geometry (senior thesis)](https://s-ye.github.io/tex/cornell/senior_thesis.pdf)

# Notes
- [Complex manifolds](https://s-ye.github.io/tex/berkeley/complex_manifolds/notes.pdf)
- [Infinite dimensional lie algebras](https://s-ye.github.io/tex/berkeley/reading_notes/inf-dim-lie-alg.pdf) for FA25 reading course on loop groups and infinite dimensional Lie algebras. 
- [Multiplicativity of the Euler characterstic](https://s-ye.github.io/tex/berkeley/reading_notes/sss.pdf) details a cute application of the Serre spectral sequence.
- [Mednykh's Formula](https://s-ye.github.io/tex/berkeley/reading_notes/finite-gauge.pdf) works out a classical formula in a toy model of topological field theory.
